```typescript
  // TODO: dragging
  // each element will also be a drop target
  // when we drop onto an element, we either show a left or a right highlight
  // depending on where the drop x is (lte 50% or greater).
  // we need to make sure the right-side of 0 looks like the left-side of 1, for example

  // TODO: resizing: ripple edit mode
  // when holding CTRL down and resizing, we'll be restricting the potential durationBeats that
  // we can explore, and also "fixing up" the neighbouring items so that only the chord in question
  // and its immediate neighbour to the left are affected. When dragging the last handle (of the
  // "--" item always present at the end of the section), we'll be unrestricted in how long we
  // can extend the previous chord.

  // TODO: rendering
  // we need to be able to render multiple boxes to split over multiple lines
  // which means that we return <>...</> and that we need to know where the breakpoints
  // are. We will need to calculate that in the SectionEditor based on current size,
  // convert to beats, and send in as a prop to all the timeline items

  // TODO: selecting
  // checkbox in top-right of item, shows on hover (or if selection is not empty)
  // allow shift-clicking to select / deselect range

  // TODO: contextual edit menu
  // when items are selected, show a menu at bottom of screen to do the following:
  // - show # items selected
  // - deselect items
  // - select all in section / song
  // - set duration in beats (default: # of beats per measure in time signature)
```
